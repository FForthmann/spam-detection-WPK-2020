MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. HERE'S GOOD NEWS There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period.

"One of a kind Money maker! Try it for free!From nobody Mon Sep 15 18:00:02 2014Content-Type: text/html;charset=""iso-8859-1""Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<body lang=EN-US><div class=Section1><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> beingbombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limitedinformation, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding yourmoney/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general withall its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main businessslowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked forsomething to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying mybills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, thisproposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! becauseI had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regretat all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you asa system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You joinonly if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of yourtime and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea ofpersonal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simplythe most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriouslyconsider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! Nokidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea oftheir overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worstyet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying tofigure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing youwith the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>Howdoes it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers thatneed to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dontwant to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustratingbattle to try to get your money back! </b></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my PlatinumChoice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totallydifferent from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise loftymega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their ownpockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every weekfor life</u> yeah, right!</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happywith my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anythingwithout corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in actionfor yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out theform as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then youare ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system andthe Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, freecorporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call meat any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me tofinally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck!</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><ahref=""http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581"">http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581</a></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Ben Green, (775) 322-3323 </p><p class=MsoBodyText>P.S.Free POP3 email is ofered for members now!</p></div></body>",1

After you have ordered all 5 reports, take thisadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of theperson in REPORT # 5. This person has made it throughthe cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26....

To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this isillegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net""Order Report #: 1 fromRui Sousa SantosP.O.

If you do not, continue advertising orsending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders forReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system isalready working for you, and the cash will continueto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every timeyour name is moved down on the list, you are placedin front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching whichreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TOGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILSAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMITto the income you can generate from this business !!!=================================================FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give youfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, withNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You canmake more money in the next few weeks and monthsthan you have ever imagined. Follow the programEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.

One of the people you send thisto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and yourname will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the morepotential customers you will reach. So my friend,I have given you the ideas, information, materialsand opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================""Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada=================================================""I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.=================================================""It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you.

"Definitely the answer many have been waiting for!!================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.",1

"Earn $139,000 a year as a DAY TRADER!It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness.

"[ILUG-Social] HELLOOFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIELFEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSINGFEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEXIKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me.

Fortunate for me, my main businessslowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked forsomething to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying mybills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, thisproposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! becauseI had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regretat all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you asa system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You joinonly if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of yourtime and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea ofpersonal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simplythe most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriouslyconsider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! Nokidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea oftheir overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worstyet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying tofigure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing youwith the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>Howdoes it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers thatneed to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dontwant to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustratingbattle to try to get your money back! </b></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my PlatinumChoice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totallydifferent from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise loftymega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their ownpockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every weekfor life</u> yeah, right!</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happywith my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anythingwithout corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in actionfor yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out theform as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes.

"[ILUG-Social] URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDEDDear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situationtill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United StateDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claimof the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties andstock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level ofconfidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust andconfidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you wherethe funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M.

"[ILUG] ASSISTANCEFROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236email : mikebundu@rediffmail.comDear Sir/MadamSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. Thisis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strangeand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of theDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic ofCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels inmy country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms andammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebelgroup. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of otherCabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before wewere schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company herein Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest andseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other MilitaryPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late PresidentLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner whocan assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under DiplomaticCover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems fromour lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who workedwith the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that withyour sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within twoweeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of thisfund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful inorder not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund outof Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personalinformation to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone'sSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal assoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise theutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.Thank you and God Bless.

"[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.Hi -( http://club.4tfox.com )You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you shouldhook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are makinga large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we willshow YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and youcan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can sendan email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But ifyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might bejust the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that isdone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increaseeach month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as afree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if youdecide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who stillhave that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will rewardthem incredibly well, if they work at it.To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the  web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following  informtion""Send me a free membership!""Be sure to include your:1.

Grand Total = $555,550.00<BR><BR>     NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND<BR>     FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND <BR>     NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL<BR>     STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>     REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10<BR>     PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.<BR><BR>Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,<BR>or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails<BR>each or more?  There are over 250 million people on the <BR>Internet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people<BR>will do just that, and more!<BR><BR>     METHOD #2:  PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>    <BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there<BR>are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of<BR>free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response.<BR>We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add METHOD<BR># 2 as you go along.<BR><BR>For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the <BR>Report they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day<BR>service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mails<BR>they send out, with your name and address on it, will be<BR>prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the<BR>report.<BR><BR>     ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER & NAME ONLY.<BR><BR>Note:  Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each report.<BR>Checks are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash is wrapped in<BR>at lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.<BR>On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAME<BR>of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAME<BR>and postal address.  Make sure you affix the proper 'International'<BR>Postage if ordering a report from outside your country.<BR><BR>     PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:<BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Report #1:  The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net<BR>Order Report #1 from:<BR><BR>K.J.

made fun of the<BR>whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.  I ""knew"" it wouldn't work.  Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when<BR>the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within<BR>3 weeks she had received 50 responses.  Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.  I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".<BR><BR>     Mitchell Wof,  Chicago, Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.  I was surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with orders.  I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so big"".<BR><BR>     Dan Sondstrom,  Alberta, Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if I should hav given it a try.  Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else . . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.  I did not <BR>delete this one!  I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all the money came within 22 weeks"".<BR><BR>     Susan De Suza,   New York, NY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money with little cost to you.  I followed the simple<BR>instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started<BR>to come in.  My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the<BR>end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.<BR>Life

"Never pay eBay listing fees again!Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web?

"Still looking for a house?My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.I need those houses...Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com Best Wishes, Jeremy Lessaris847.366.4300www.synteligent.comjeremy@synteligent.comTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.orgwith ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",1

To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this isillegal or somehow ""wrong"".

My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================""Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada=================================================""I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.=================================================""It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of thethird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand=================================================ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOURROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !=================================================If you have any questions of the legality of thisprogram, contact the Office of Associate Directorfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.This message is sent in compliance of the proposedbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. * This message is not intended for residents in theState of Washington, Virginia or California,screening of addresses has been done to the bestof our technical ability.*  This is a one time mailing and this list willnever be used again.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",1

"Special Affiliate Offers from Amazon.Com!                   Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young ""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know that many young African American women refuse to date African American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as ""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make investments?     ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story! These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of ""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or cool neighborhood reputation. The author also identifies the self-destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" today.

"[ILUG] MICHAEL ! ilug ilug , From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,          Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's! regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family.   -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",1

Myclient has informed me of the existence of fundsdeposited with a security company abroad. This fundcame about as part of security votes that wereallocated to my client's portfolio during his tenureas chief security adviser to the then president. Whathappened was that he had part of the funds transferredfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to thissecurity outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personalsecurity outfit of thethen president. But before the purchase could takeplace the president died. My client has decided tokeep this for himself as all his properties has beenconfisticated by the present regime. But due to hisincarceration he cannot travel out and effect thechange of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for aforeign partner that can help him facilitate thechange of possession.

"SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika.          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________Powered by List BuilderTo unsubscribe follow the link:http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4",1

What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE.

Jody and I live in Chicago.<BR>I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I make<BR>pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to Jody about receiving ""junk mail"".  I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.  I ""knew"" it wouldn't work.  Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when<BR>the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within<BR>3 weeks she had received 50 responses.  Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.  I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".<BR><BR>     Mitchell Wof,  Chicago, Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.  I was surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with orders.  I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so big"".<BR><BR>     Dan Sondstrom,  Alberta, Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if I should hav given it a try.  Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else . . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.  I did not <BR>delete this one!  I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all the money came within 22 weeks"".<BR><BR>     Susan De Suza,   New York, NY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money with little cost to you.  I followed the simple<BR>instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started<BR>to come in.  My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the<BR>end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.<BR>Life

"SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika.          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________Powered by List BuilderTo unsubscribe follow the link:http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5",1

To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this isillegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :==================================================REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net""Order Report #1 from:Robert Borowczykul. J. Olbrachta 118C m. 2801-373 WarsawPoland______________________________________________________REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending BulkEmail On The Net""Order Report # 2 from: Mohammad FaraziyanEngelbertstr. 25 40233 DüsseldorfGermany______________________________________________________REPORT # 3: ""Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net""Order Report # 3 from:Luis PastorApartado 8148080BilbaoSpain ______________________________________________________REPORT # 4: ""How To Become A Millionaire UsingMLM & The Net""Order Report # 4 from: Ali RezaAuf den Holln 6844894 BochumGermany ______________________________________________________REPORT # 5: ""How To Send Out One Million EmailsFor Free""Order Report # 5 From:J.sidenkrondikesvägen 54 A83147 ÖstersundSweden ______________________________________________________$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders forReport #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mailsuntil you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeksafter that you should receive 100 orders or more forREPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising orsending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders forReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system isalready working for you, and the cash will continueto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every timeyour name is moved down on the list, you are placedin front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching whichreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TOGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILSAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMITto the income you can generate from this business !!!=================================================FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give youfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, withNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You canmake more money in the next few weeks and monthsthan you have ever imagined. Follow the programEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting reportafter you have put your name and address inReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 asinstructed above. One of the people you send thisto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and yourname will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the morepotential customers you will reach. So my friend,I have given you the ideas, information, materialsand opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================""Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada=================================================""I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.=================================================""It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of thethird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand=================================================ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOURROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !=================================================If you have any questions of the legality of thisprogram, contact the Office of Associate Directorfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.This message is sent in compliance of the proposedbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. * This message is not intended for residents in theState of Washington, Virginia or California,screening of addresses has been done to the bestof our technical ability.*  This is a one time mailing and this list willnever be used again.",1

"Your eBay account is about to expire!Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could bemaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  Thisis no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to workto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how tobuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hotproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delaystarting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.

This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund. If you are interested to carry out this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us.You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy communication Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 (seven) working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} _________________________________________________________ Envoyez des messages musicaux sur le portable de vos amis  http://mobile.lycos.fr/mobile/local/sms_musicaux/",1

"FW: Make Money Fast And Legal! As Seen on TV! 65000$+THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just simply delete it. READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. Believe it, work it. This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders (money) started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a try!! You will be glad you did. Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't delete this!!! ------------------------------------------------------ First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET! Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year"". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever 15-year-old. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills. ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"". Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework"". He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, ""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee. [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions]. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================================Here is another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first: ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: ================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ================= For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ================================================================ **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================================ Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out.

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================================ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS ========================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================================ '' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================================ '' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. =============================================================== '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

"BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP(URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL)Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Standard Trust Bank Ltd, Lagos,Nigeria. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. Thanks and Regards, MR.VINCENT NNAJI.",1

This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass! must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!* Mill-stoned & honed.* Depressive regressive!* Psychologically uplifting!* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.* Sweet aphrodisia!

As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight.

"Free Excerpt;  Baby Makers, Loser Choosers, & Welfare Abusers...Images of My America!                         ForewordAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in ""Ghetto America,"" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the ""Black Generation X"". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers"", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X"", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows:   ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.""""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong."" This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance, ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say, "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,"" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all ""we"" have time for. I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me,"" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical. Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers"", a popular rap duo, have a song called ""I'm Still Fly"", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:""I got gator boots with a pimped out GucciSuit, can't pay my rent cause all my money'sspent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.""Worse yet, in the song ""Grinding"", the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers manI bake them cakes as fast as I canand you can tell cause of how my bread stack upand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup""In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al luded too. I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans"", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as ""Black"", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as ""Niggas,"" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as ""Ghetto"", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design. There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug,"" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that ""backward thinking"" is the main  cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.************************************************************* To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.comTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.orgwith ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",1

"What Warren Buffett won't tell ya ...It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game.

Fortunate for me, my main businessslowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked forsomething to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying mybills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, thisproposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! becauseI had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regretat all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you asa system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You joinonly if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of yourtime and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea ofpersonal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simplythe most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriouslyconsider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! Nokidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea oftheir overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worstyet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying tofigure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing youwith the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>Howdoes it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers thatneed to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dontwant to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustratingbattle to try to get your money back! </b></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my PlatinumChoice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totallydifferent from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise loftymega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their ownpockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every weekfor life</u> yeah, right!</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happywith my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anythingwithout corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p><p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in actionfor yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out theform as soon as you can.

"ADV: Internet marketing & communications; earn $100k/year... uleioHELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, youwill see how you can learn new skills in communication,do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at thesame time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you toCHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!************SUMMARY***************************Just read this Summary, follow the actions that it advises,and start earning some serious money.  You will learn newskills in communications and how to market on the internet.What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,and you have not joined in this program before, thentake out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mailout $10.00 each to the following people to purchase fiveGuides on communications.  For each Guide that you willbe ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain whitepaper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAILADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide thatyou are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 billinside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 billinto an envelope, address the envelope with the name andaddress of the person whose name is shown under eachGuide below, and mail the envelope by first class or airmail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on theenvelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.LIST OF FIVE NAMES****************************________________________________________________GUIDE# 1: ""How to be A More Effective Public Speaker""Order Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition toGuide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing Guide""A Million Bucks From the Internet"", free of charge)Derrick Nguyen9530 Whitmore StEl Monte, CA 91733USA________________________________________________GUIDE # 2: ""How to Give a Business Presentation""Order Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:Tim FaiGPO Box 260Macau (via Hong Kong)________________________________________________GUIDE# 3: ""How to Write More Effectively""Order Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:Luis PastorApartado 8148080 BilbaoSpain________________________________________________GUIDE # 4: ""What to do at a Social Function""Order Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:Chester Waldvogel11 Chestnut WayBerlin, MD 21811USA________________________________________________GUIDE # 5: ""How To Sharpen Your Mind""Order Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:J. SidenKrondikesvagen 54 A83147 OstersundSweden________________________________________________END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save theseGuides on your computer's hard disk as other people will beordering these Guides from you, paying you for them andyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name andaddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace thatslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4'sslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, andreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, andreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, andreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, andreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. Thisstep is how your own name and address is entered into thelist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,your own name will go down the list of names until you havereached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. Thekey point is that the number of people ordering Guides fromyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send outthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) toas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailingsyou make, potentially the greater the number of people whowill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will thenmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the emailshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest ofthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 stepsshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out asmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and helpthose who purchase the Guides from you to send outemails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediatereaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the listwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.That might seem to you like a clever move because newbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  Butthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.What will benefit you most is having people who will sendout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to newbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going tobe sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself byeffectively closing down the program with your name ontop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  Therewouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuverwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have donethe work, and your name has worked its way to furtherdown the list, by then you deserve the rewards andearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical foranyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don'tdo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 tothe five people on the list that one of the people will justtake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, restassured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have youas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to findnew buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try tocheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the listwould rather have you working hard because your effort willbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers sendyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the dealby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success inthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinarypeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether aRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you canafford to buy that new car or home that you have beenlooking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I neverresponded to one of these before either. One day though,something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a moviefor 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simplemeat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter whereyou believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every daythat feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doinghad I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image andconfidence and at the same time have the potential to recoveryour investment and make some good money: making overhalf a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about directmarketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketingvia the internet is the way sales and marketing will be donein the future, then the experience you will gain here couldbe a real boost in your work career, possibly even providinga new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message untilyou understand it completely and feel confident to followthrough on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE ANDYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. Youare offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as suchand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable periodof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself andthe others on the list of five.===========================================*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHERCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and thatyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much betterbut let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people willsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded alsosend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out ofthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 ordersfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails eachfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% responseis 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a totalof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  Thismay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used avery low response rate with a small number of emails beingsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rateup just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyoneor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000emails each or more?  From the example above, you can seethe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is theamount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwideand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there areMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads onthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you startwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email theGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and adviseyou how to get the large number of email addresses thatyou need to send the new email containing your name andaddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides totheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because yourname would be further down the list, and their new buyerswill buy from you.  This is no different than ""customerservice"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal orsomehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checksor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing itis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelopeand steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for eachGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hiddenby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one ofthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAMEof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESSand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address theenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps tomail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOWFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWNAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL________________________________________________YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. Ifnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, andcash should continue coming in!

"[ILUG] Do NOT Drop your Life InsuranceDear ilug@linux.ie Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates.

"URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE.From nobody Mon Sep 15 18:00:02 2014Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitKEVIN GEORGEABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIEWEST AFRICADearest one,Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebelsin my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving nextof kin to my father.But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such atime that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helpingme to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684I remain yours sincerely,KEVIN GEORGE                                                                            ---------------------------------Yahoo!

"YOUR ANTICIPATED ASSISTANT IS REQUIRED.I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards. MR.IKE EJOH",1
"A better investment than the stock market.All our mailings are sent complying to the proposed H.R. 3113 UnsolicitedCommercial Electronic Mail Act of 2000. Please see the bottom of thismessage for further information and removal instructions.PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN INHIS CLOSET!Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely havejust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away whenshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buriedbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-oldsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got whenshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-oldwoman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than myhusband earns in a year"".The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership wherehe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right awayand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little didthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking thanactually finding it in the closet.As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everydayafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on hiscomputer in his bedroom.""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my nameon it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever15-year-old.The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the topand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name tothe top of the list.The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousanddollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with yourname at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, andreally did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Boxthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptionsbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my boxhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also ayellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought Iwas in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to thecounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride backhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Overthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  Themoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in thecloset, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his biketo several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different bankswith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell thelady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange themoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me areally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for meand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the nextbank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have anyreason to be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy wassending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it wascompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also inthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, whichstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letterlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand howthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before yousay ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have beenhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entireshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it reallycan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not theprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and ifpeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make somemegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THISPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTERTHAN EVER.Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time whenI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent sothat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using thefollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept moneyfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad Ifinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimaleffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in themail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructionsand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month Ionly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, Ihave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key tosuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT changeanything.""

MAKESURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports fromthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will beaccessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them fromyou. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in casesomething happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed nextto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what isinstructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority ofyour profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also seehow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has beentested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put theirfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedyand then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other thanwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,honesty reaps the reward!!!1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement andREMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This personhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #26....

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on adisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketingyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide youwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulke-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and muchmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we willassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let'salso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the responsecould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 millione-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUTTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOUCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a momentwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those peoplemailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do justthat, and more!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds ofFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet willeasily get a larger response.We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 asyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them theReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on allorders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your nameand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until theyreceive the report.=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Alwayssend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOTaccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Writethe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++REPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the NetOrder Report #1 from:R.

I am anaccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of thepopulation and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped inwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was onme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up mymind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided thatthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that Iwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I wassurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed withorders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing aboutthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big"".Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if Ishould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someoneelse......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not deletethis one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the moneycame within 22 weeks"".Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++If you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the Officeof Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington,D.C.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This email was sent to you via Saf-E Mail Systems.

"Best news yetINVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. Research Alert - UndervaluedAugust 26, 2002XrayMedia(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!How does the company do this? XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding.
