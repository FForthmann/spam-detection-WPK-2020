It can read right throughmisspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the authorabove suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anythinglike the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason thefirst letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important isthat without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentiallymore difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to beresolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are farless important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity ofthis continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Evenfor descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendentsof slaves, who were brought here by force.More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity inwealth has nothing to do with it.It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, onlyindividuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth isstatistical sophistry.Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealthis almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even whenthere are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still theresince 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes onwealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,they're nowhere near the top.I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislatedmonopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, likewhat happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, morepeople living longer.I'll take those odds as well.

No other detailswere immediately available.The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax andITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted totalk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, withinblocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded theman, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the newsagencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outsidethe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and droveto a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities heldfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said.

"Re: Goodbye Global WarmingI've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forumsfor several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for noparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that Iactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com--------------------------------------------http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bountyof a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, EdKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor andamateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don'tlive this high up.' ""Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from abisonone that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinarydiscovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that itcould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There'sprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.""And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers andsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peruto Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars andindustryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. Asthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts isemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deepfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the muckyfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of ourpredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced throughstudying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitudearchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National GeographicSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discoveredin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""IceMan,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, haveoffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, asthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasionaltreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before MotherNatureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains candeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they'reoften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon themdon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier inBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was adead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I lookedcloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a furtrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Locbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumedthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and whatseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunterlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long AgoPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (whomay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved humanfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region couldexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in thefirst place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of peopleliving here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now wesee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedekcaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the southYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered incaribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't beencaribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then awildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like apencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of theice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layercakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to theice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discardedsome equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing dartsup until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the researchproject. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwingdarts.""Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. Theyare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on whereglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known tohave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangelland St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciatedterrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawingEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite asthe Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitudearchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We'reprobably about the only ones happy about it.""",0

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency  by have some play with time and valueMost people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's  called congnitive dissonance theoryMost businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaroundfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only wayinconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. The local information when combined with the technicaltroubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronizationto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones whenconcerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is howpeople cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarilypre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neckwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that thewhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistentlybe in its proper place.Greg",0

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be recovered on demand.These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between traditional ATA and SCSI drives.For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server environments.""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these enterprise applications.""The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a three-year warranty.The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications.With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""AvailabilityLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.About MaxtorMaxtor Corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world's leading suppliers of information storage solutions.

"NYTimes.com Article: Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Another reminder that the moral writ of intellectual property is -- and ought to --be more limited than real property. Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P.Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduVast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedSeptember 30, 2002By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON  What is almost certainly the most sophisticated andcomplete understanding of exactly how and why the twintowers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled aspart of a largely secret proceeding in federal court inLower Manhattan. Amassed during the initial stages of a complicatedinsurance lawsuit involving the trade center, theconfidential material contains data and expert analysisdeveloped by some of the nation's most respectedengineering minds. It includes computer calculations thathave produced a series of three-dimensional images of thecrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,helping to identify the sequence of failures that led tothe collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of thedebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also beenaccumulated in a collection that far outstrips whatgovernment analysts have been able to put together as theystruggle to answer the scientifically complex andemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadlyfailures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives ofvictims fear that the closely held information, whichincludes the analysis and the possible answers thatfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, mayremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, theexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as theywait for the case to play out. Such restrictions aretypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as itnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed thatcertain material can remain secret for the time being - hasapproved standard legal arrangements that, should thelawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucialmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. ""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, butwe can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""WhyBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2ndedition, 2002). ""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the wholeprocess"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when thesouth tower fell and who is a member of the SkyscraperSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.""If they have answers and are not going to share them, Iwould be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have amoral obligation."" The lawsuit that has generated the information involvesLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on thetrade center property, and a consortium of insurancecompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetlinerthat hit the towers constituted a separate terroristattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than halfthat amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they havespent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expertopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers ofHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, saidof the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreementsthat are keeping those out of the public domain today."" Heconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20insurers on his side of the case could complicate anyrelease of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone haveproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands ofdiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attemptwould be made to give the material eventually to ""publicauthorities and investigative teams."" Still, some of that analysis relies on information likeblueprints and building records from other sources, likethe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which builtand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein inthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how thediffering origins of the material would influence hiscompany's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documentswould be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent withapplicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperatewith ""federal investigations."" The fate of the research is particularly critical toresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry intothe buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by theFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by fewresources, a lack of access to crucial information likebuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.A new federal investigation intended to remedy thosefailings has just begun at the National Institute ofStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that hasstudied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to makefinal determinations and recommendations for otherbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speededup with access to the analysis done by the consultants onthe lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said ofthe real estate executive's own heavily financedinvestigative work, ""We decline to comment other than tosay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NISTinvestigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it wasin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, butsaid no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations byboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling bodyof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to thetrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. ""The work should be available to other investigators,"" saidRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partnerat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlierinquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in thefuture."" Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the onegoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,from full or partial disclosure to destruction of suchinformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for thereports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask tohave them sealed forever. ""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keepsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a FirstAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of theinformation, the court might look favorably on requests tomake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of thematerial is unnerving to many people, especially expertswho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protecttheir own interests - could lead to an advance in thefederal investigation of the trade center. ""It's important for this to get presented and published andsubjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,director of civil engineering practice at Exponent FailureAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on thecase, ""because then the general engineering community cansort it out."" The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast byany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at WeidlingerAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have calledupon powerful computer programs, originally developed withthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model ofthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images ofthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damagedcore of the towers, beginning with the impacts andproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helpedpinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computermodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access tothe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeksimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraintshampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought tothe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon ofSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and aconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said hehad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at groundzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about howthe towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where thingsactually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated thespecific locations."" Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional detailsof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the detailsof computer calculations his company has done on the spreadof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive ofphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some ofwhich he believes have not been available to otherinvestigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computersand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in windtunnels in the United States and Canada have been examiningthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressedthe weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in FortCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies buthad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for theoriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. Forthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably moredetailed measurements than in the original design."" ""The data that have been acquired are very valuable inthemselves for understanding how wind and buildingsinteract,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may bevaluable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I thinkI've told you all I can.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1HOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contactonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

"[zzzzteana] Language problemsAnanova:  Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture captionReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture captionabout jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languagesspoken in Namibia.Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, whichtranslates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings fromthe femidon - female condom - as jewellery.According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIVpatients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people'slanguages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...Andthat the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in variousNamibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which inSiyeyi means testicles.Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambotranslates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's haveintercourse.The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.Story filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002------------------------ Yahoo!

"Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman    Empire/g)I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived ona couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwestand also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And myparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations thanI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  Ido get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-handfrom my father.The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly becauseit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While itis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as aconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, notsomething that was impressed upon them.The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entitythat exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""IndianCorporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns asingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies fromtribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of thetribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k perperson, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number ofplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and variousbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribesare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for theirshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is veryhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happytake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from thecorporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accountingpurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no oneworks, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain thosedividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so becausethey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies isthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor whitefolk, not Indians.Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they alsoreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporationto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  Bybenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no otherordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations areineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority arevery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with goodcredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is theHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, hasbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own havegross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet thedividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particularcase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades beforedrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led tointelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and haveactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federalgovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  Thisparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expendituresper person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and manyborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousanddollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation ratherthan their own pockets.Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuableassets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously givenwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreigncompanies.  And the cycle continues.So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In anutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, andgross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse duringpregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a verysubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many ofthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at theearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On onereservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many ofthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law isarbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, policeetc).In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in ashambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that Ihave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren'tthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that Icould tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unlessyou'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, butit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the goodguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism asa minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police areopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  Itwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperousIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined andintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second iswhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even ifthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the triballeaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathologicalcases mentioned above.The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spentby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite highwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It isjust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well toordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  Thepoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was myoriginal point.On a tangent:One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribalcorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporatesocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use thisstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what hasinterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly wellover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasinglyvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Westernsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family withthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selectingindividuals.Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com On 9/22/02 3:53 PM, ""John Hall"" <johnhall@evergo.net> wrote:> > As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans> who speak english at home and those who do not.

"RE: Goodbye Global Warming""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, ishighly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geologicaltimescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that thesupposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absoluteterms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noisefloor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rateof temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of globaltemperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degreehere or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that globaltemperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain whytemperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the lastcouple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geologicalstandards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to useclimate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers depositedduring the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence ofhumans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glacierspaved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into abit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buriedin and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by theice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""savethe glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that theirexistence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations areanthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'lljust stick with Occam's Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.comOn Mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, Jim Whitehead wrote:> > For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the> dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global> temperature.

"[zzzzteana] Punch bags filled with incontinence padshttp://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633932.Bizarre+London.0.htmlAn investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover why the bags contain such unusual contents.""12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com------------------------ Yahoo!

"A billion here, a billion there...> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have > endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he > ever coined it.An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* FAQ) and ""eyewitness"" reporting without a single written source. What the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much more skeptical if the ""quote"" emerged after his death... RK===============================================================http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm""A billion here, a billion there . . .""Did Dirksen ever say, "" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money""? (or anything very close to that?)Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him.Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations.Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed ""Ev and Charlie"" and ""Ev and Jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling:""As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic hazard.""Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said, I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'"" [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another ""spending"" story, one he labeled ""cat in the well"":""One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, Johnny, a cat fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the well?'""Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while, and then when the teacher came down and said, How are you getting along?' Johnny said, Teacher, if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes I can land that cat in hell.'""If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do not find much to cheer about concerning it."" [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].But there are no such reminders for the ""A billion here, a billion there . . . "" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no authoritative reference to the ""billion"" phrase.The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up nothing in the way of confirmation.The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, ""The favorite sum of money is $1 billion  a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there."" [EMD Papers, Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the ""and pretty soon you're talking real money"" is missing.In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted Dirksen: ""Look at education  two-and-one-half billion  a billion for this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. You'll be deeply in the red."" [Cited in Byron Hulsey's ""Everett Dirksen and the Modern Presidents,"" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of Texas, p. 226]Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and career  he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped capture.Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he ever coined it.  ---My permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu",0
"Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sNormally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.htmlhttp://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.htmlhttp://www.mindprod.com/(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in.A loving person lives in a loving world,A hostile person lives in a hostile world.Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence as when you give offence.

"[zzzzteana] Hitler-style applicant welcomed by partiesThe Times   September 06, 2002  Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties By Roger Boyes    MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the Führer.   Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter, signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald.   The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for membership.   The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany. History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.   The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive, the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923.   Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in Cologne, said.   Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor.   I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic.   For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said.   I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.   ------------------------ Yahoo!

The freight still isn't moving,factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, andretailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passingday. On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, thenext step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to workfor 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over thedisputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health orsafety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chaocovered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the workstoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quicklyresponded that their members have been unloading military cargothroughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but ananonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.""Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartleywould annoy labor right before congressional elections. On theother hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of theincreasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up inpolls, and such concerns may have outweighed the politicaldanger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a pollreported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiasedexamination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up hismind that it was hurting national security and the economy,andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP. As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labordisputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workerssimply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78days until Christmas.

We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satelliteplayers want to join forces, the better to compete with BigCable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the JusticeDepartment, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate ofDirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposedmerger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTVand EchoStar is Dish. All straight?The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to holdoff ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the JusticeDepartment has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss withJustice in the next weeks.The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form thoserevisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequenciesto Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal forinvestors in the satellite space. It seems the market forexpanded-service television may be nearing saturation.TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, butshareholders may realize much smaller returns.""The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings.

And the bandwidth shadows in most citiesare surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, whichis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize nextgeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a largescale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wirelessconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots andothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transitconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimizethe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wirelessis tied into fiber at multiple points.The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, buta mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidthmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up towell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges andbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by anorder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows andproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize thecost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providerscan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly lowbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level oflarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effectivebandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company'slong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary tokeep things sane.Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into thesystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is moreefficient).-James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

"[zzzzteana] Compensation for World's youngest motherhttp://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.htmlLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. ""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. ""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 'Totally willing to help'Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. ""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. Medical rarityNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" Happy ending?Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. ""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. ""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an eraof corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of thecountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon theprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few handsand the Republic is destroyed.""Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col.

"Apple Sauced...againOver on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired articlethat goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love andrespect for its users.http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.htmlThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over athttp://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gaina competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface intheir applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverseengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popularthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (thirdparty or otherwise) was in development.All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because theprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would haveupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they haveresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the firstplace.But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forciblyexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, itis not allowed to load.It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understandssomething that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platformvendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. InApple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards tomake every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via publicAPIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be thenumber one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, ifthird party developers want to sell into a market that requires thedesired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must beprepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developereffort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing toprovide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish.

One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitiousrendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fictionis more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again inhistory:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The JuniorAnthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only becameJunior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before youknow it the charade takes on a life of its own which the PrimitivePeople are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there issubstantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, thefacts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fictionthat is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. AmericanIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the mythin popular culture.I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter whereyou are on the planet.

"[zzzzteana] Nobel astrophysicistsNobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PMSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize inphysics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves innature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneeringcontributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmicX-ray sources.''Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the otherhalf of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of theUniversity of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giantunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream fromthe sun by the billion.Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings becausethey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a SouthDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrinodetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, andalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some ofthe brightest objects in the universe.The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize forbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - andsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to thediscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into thehearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outsideWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshibaalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reachDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons SydneyBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at theKarolinska Institute.The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organgrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on howviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such asAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesdaymorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory ofAlfred Nobel later the same day.The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the SwedishAcademy said on Tuesday.The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates arenot publicly revealed for 50 years.Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite whoendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given tothose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the fieldof physics.''The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry andeconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and expertsin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conductedin strict secrecy.The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.---On the Net:Nobel site, http://www.nobel.se ------------------------ Yahoo!

"Re: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)Definitional nit to pick:Robert Harley writes:> It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,> precisely identical between males and females.> > Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. ""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Letthere be three pairings which result in each personhaving sex once. Then, let one of the males also have sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partnersis equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are: - above the single partner threshold - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more ""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.- Gordon",0

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likelyto result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed towin all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. ""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.

"Colonial Script ...Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over theAmerican Colonies.

Second, theissuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.

"RE: OSCOM Berkeley report: Xopus, Bitflux, Plone, XoopsI attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems thatJim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparentlybeen used in some fairly large implementations and looked like somepretty strong competition to commercial systems:- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based contentmanagement framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.spamassassin.taint.org/software/ccm/cms/- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.orgThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open sourcestrength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movementtowards improving that situation.I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took forgranted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took itjust as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignoreXML almost completely. I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used toapply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked howcompletely out of scope document management was (almost no considerationof the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than theoccasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that wasfunctional): this seems more the case in open source content managementthan in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier toignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state ofcurrent tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd writtendown what he said, something like ""it sucks so extremely, it sucks sowidely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there isno hope."" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercialsystems scaled so well that the commercial ""big boys"" were really muchmore functional than open source, until someone pointed out, ""OK, takesome average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scalepretty well.""

"[zzzzteana] Big cats 'on the increase'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stmBig cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards recordnumbers, a monitoring group has claimed. The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports ofanimals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigersover the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than theaverage moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with thecritics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the samerealm as the Loch Ness monster. ""But it's not, they are really out there."" 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of thecountry. Big cat reports  Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  ""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist insufficient numbers to breed among themselves. ""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, includingphotographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical publicthat it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera andtake a picture of itself."" 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into thewild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had bigcats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. ""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, peoplereleased their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put themdown, or take them to a zoo.""------------------------ Yahoo!

Bush proclaimed, ""The problem withthe French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""story has been taken up by those who like their caricaturesdrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt thatemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's PresidentJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with theFrench,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don'thave a word for entrepreneur.""The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the BaronessWilliams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" hadrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach BaronessWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he didreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director ofcommunications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the primeminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainlynever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it musthave been a joke.""This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt ofa jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less thanstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memoriestoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we'vechronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of themoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in theranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being peggedas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of theintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamusquatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would winthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, itwas the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folksto chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectualshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because theyseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about thispublic figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's everbeen.

"The Next World Orderhttp://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_FACT1The New YorkerTHE NEXT WORLD ORDERby NICHOLAS LEMANNThe Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.Issue of 2002-04-01Posted 2002-03-25When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new peopleoften persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyonesuspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the BushAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by afather-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believethat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family hasresumed its governance-and about time, too.The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, orworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense andforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of asClinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article inForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clintonof ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of thecommander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in thisAdministration also served under the President's father. They took officelast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswattingby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administrationforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the OvalRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whosecover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of theworld, and these words:Defense Strategy for the 1990s:The Regional Defense StrategySecretary of DefenseDick CheneyJanuary 1993One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government iscommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even electedpoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then performpublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defenseare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is goto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, toexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the seniorofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from ahigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playingCarnegie Hall?After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary ofDefense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreignpolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whoseexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, ata higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary ofDefense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a seniorforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group ofconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, andintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (DonaldRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and hasbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) ColinPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted acompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagineAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on whicheach team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief PresidentBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling thenew grand strategy.Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sensethat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz andPowell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, buthis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn'tget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States inthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his majorforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day thatIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of thematerial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagonenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, preventany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks ofcontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denialsand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheneyteam's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that thesenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days beforeClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained theessential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of theworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one ofskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of thesame ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to GlobalLeadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 andis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into theClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends thatthe United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for theindefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest topreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessaryfor the purpose.""When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people aroundhim didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines ofthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence whichthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first majorforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""aPresident must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems toconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly theforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partlybecause it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominatingworld affairs for any length of time.One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terroristattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bushhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domesticsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are trulyentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are thatBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change indirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congresssince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind whichhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment ofdestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertivepolicymaking.Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""atransformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, isnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officialshad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the Americanpublic's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, atleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""BlackHawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on theconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombingKosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreignmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, theoptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than themilitary or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed thatthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation toprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The Americandeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice'sForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The UnitedStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still thecase. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she saidimmediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakesthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weaponsof mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define thenational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech toCongress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was endingterrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face thepart of the White House grounds where television reporters do theirstandups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she doesin public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind ofmissionary calm, rather than belligerence.In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and powerbalances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now shesounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney'sPentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that theother great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because ofthe terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, therealists would predict that when you have a great power like the UnitedStates it would not be long before you had other great powers rising tochallenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think whatyou're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move toproductive and coöperative relations with the United States, rather than totry to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft mattersin how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of theNational Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how doyou capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change Americandoctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""Ireally think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events soclearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a bigglobal threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normallythought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting thetectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try toseize on that and position American interests and institutions and all ofthat before they harden again.""The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annualdocument called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goalsof American policy-another government report whose importance is great butnot obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as theClinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she isworking on the report now.""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do itin a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it'simportant. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, priorto 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but Iwould think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a realstatement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic directionthat it's going.""It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominantAmerican role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Somequestions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously beingasked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone inforeign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engenderinside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak acouple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensivecapability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of officialadherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication ofthe scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States nowin a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the BushAdministration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly itis, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a fewmonths ago.Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggestedto me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction inforeign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz orRichard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, hepublished a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a littlefun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (hecalled it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the UnitedStates should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""Itsimply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another ofthe Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haassargued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, notmore, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditionalgreat-power politics.""Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary ofDefense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in hisoffice at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was anarray of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine andthe first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington thatHaass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreignpolicy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard caseto make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's theeconomy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are verydifferent now. One, the President has a much easier time making the casethat foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-securitycharts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad asKennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing fromthis Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body ofideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call thelimits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not tomassacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some ofthe normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left aloneinside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even leadto a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially canact in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,and not if, you're going to be attacked.""Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American publicneeds a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make thecase. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case thatthis isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was stillmaintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not longbefore called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a bigdifference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have tobe a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there arestill limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas oneveryone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others tojoin us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It hasto be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can'tsend forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I thinkthere is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on tocertain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition toterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policiesand then building institutions that lock them in even more.""The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a newAmerican foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. Whatthe United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what'sbeen done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of theoperation itself and in terms of its aftermath.Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage ofhis aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public eventwas a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi'sleading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and formerDefense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremelyconfident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mountingthat the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealingwith Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing hisregime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with atwinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suitand a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and hissupporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient Americansupport, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated theTaliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people inWashington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebelmilitary leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the trayover tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagonofficial told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam'smilitary is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has beenquite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The UnitedStates left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to aninternal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weakernow, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing couldfinish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the ideathat a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment ofanywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American groundtroops.Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National SecurityCouncil's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the ClintonAdministration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world bypublishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authorspublished an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the IraqiNational Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn'tthink Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require asubstantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the onewe used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now inAfghanistan.Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given abriefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office inWashington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk andwalked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East werehanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using apen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to threehundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in theTigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultanairbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easierin Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointingagain-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oilfields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oilfields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend theKurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, asfast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get theenemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" Hishand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removedthe government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviouslyshaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,which before September 11th clearly met the new test of nationalunacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of massdestruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country isnot wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of DanielPearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligenceservice, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must beestablished-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is noobvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawnstrong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is anuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internalaffairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, SaudiArabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to becomedirectly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wantedto do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the waythat Europe was immediately after the Second World War.In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediatemoves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is anindication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration'sconservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who isclose to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance isfutile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, isintellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and sinceSeptember 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at leastthe beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptancepractically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies thedoctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zoneof democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility withthe Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whomsee the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewiswas invited to the White House in December to brief the seniorforeign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of theworld, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the seniorofficial I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn'tproceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it isprepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interestingthinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essaydeclared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who publishedan article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime inIran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could beaccomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of thenations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going tofinish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatictour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamelyabsorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, theAdministration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance ofthe world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that theUnited States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support itsactions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructureof international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would testthat policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting thatit can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publiclyopposed the Iraq operation.When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it askedfor a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improvemilitary pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated asan unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war onterrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion ofIraq.This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries aboutthe invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bushbuilds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about theunacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A dramainvolving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the springand summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the termsthat Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, theenormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. TheAdministration obviously feels confident that the United States caneffectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troopbuildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause theRepublican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddamand topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to afull-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently willbegin soon.Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney'sfuture-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, nowworks in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking theWest Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet ofpublic-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication ofhis 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""DickCheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appearsabsolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result ofthe influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravellyrumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression ofhaving calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstructionwhich the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting forthose charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the onlytruly prudent course.When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, beforeSeptember 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have beendifferent. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the MiddleEast. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discoveryof the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World TradeCenter, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of aserious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobarbombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassybombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing ofthe Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and thefailure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take thatlong list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged peoplefrom supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against ourinterests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouragedfurther aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to riseup and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defendthemselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They aremorally weak.' ""Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not beenstandard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done inAfghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session ofCongress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made itclear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe inexpanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. Andhe had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and tobegin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there isnot a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He couldhave waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engagedin long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a newrelationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been soafraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list couldgo on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations whilestanding up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't knowyet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations notonly with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with thestates of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with thestates of Southwest Asia more generally.""We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Husseinunacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of massdestruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, theirpromise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they madein '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problemsI listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraqwas given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed totake that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regimewill, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spokeslowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to haveconfidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""-- -----------------R. A.

However, the additional information won't be required.The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous political spam.Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from the financial disclosure requirement.

"Sun Nabs Storage Startup - buys Pirus NetworksRelated to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?==http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage StartupBy Clint BoultonAmid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in SanFrancisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase datastorage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startupwith a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices andvirtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devicesinto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device thatis managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likesof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus afterscouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.comthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possibleacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot ofstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, suchas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as acritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have arole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styledas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers andnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining groundin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president ofIDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largestincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter ofSun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.",0

Hacktress and         Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. ""I am here at         the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I         would check to see if there is connectivity"", she writes,         somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit         the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window         and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the         Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,         reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd         could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,         they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk         and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four         or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends         them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we         imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail         loops on.         http://lists.bawug.org/pipermail/wireless/2002-August/008507.html                                 - administrivia: HI MOM, I'M IN JAIL    http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@wasabisystems.com/msg02554.html                             - Green/Palladium, like Green Kryptonite         Could Lucky get himself arrested under the DMCA for         distributing a circumvention device?

Will even the nicest         UK cryptographer (or curious garage tinkerer) find         themselves hauled up under our new and scarily DMCAish         copyright regime? Find out the facts at the free FAIR DEAL         FOR COPYRIGHT conference, organised by the irrepressible         FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION POLICY RESEARCH for Wednesday         2002-09-18 at the London School of Economics. All the usual         fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto         cons: we confidently predict government spokesmen caught in         headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig         fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other         epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker         ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme         Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We         suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's         job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for         a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.         http://www.fipr.org/vacancy.html- doesn't the Foundation use psychohistory for filling these positions?         For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without          thinking of Martian fighting machines and their ""deafening          howls... which roared like thunder"", we're sorry to report          that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR          OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to ""health and safety          issues"". The event was to feature computer graphics,          fireworks, ""60ft-tall Martian fighting machines"" wreaking          ""havoc and destruction"", and - most terrifyingly of all - the          possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with          Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at          Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new          venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original          invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety          issues, ""slain after all man's devices had failed by the          humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this          earth: bacteria.

"UCI Creative WritingMore articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is thecenter of the universe.  We've got the corner on electriccars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.UCI's creative writing department has been in the news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Somequotes from the article[1]:   ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring    and uncannily timely novel. The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""TheLovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease meabout UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobodyknew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UCschools, and when I went off to college in 1985, myrelatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"".   If therewas ever any two classes that helped contributed to writingmy dissertation, it was that one which taught me how toget the writing flowing and my high school typing classwhich taught me how to type really fast.  One of the advantages they cite in the article is that theyseem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but accordingto the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone onto write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industryis creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent whichcreates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out moresuccess stories which lures more talent.

"[ILUG] Marketing SIG has a good start :)         |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|                IT's Monday 520      02 September 2002              |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUXbyJohn SterneThe launch last month of a marketing special interest group by theIrish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, itseems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has alreadysparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  Whenthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student willbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran atraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that theLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irishuniversities.The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programmethat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open sourcestyle of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educationalchannel' to reach this audience, bundling educational softwarewith its operating environment and offering networked supportservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designedto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available toschools and universities throughout the world.Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenancefeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard tomaster on personal systems.The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of RedHat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financialservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until nowits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices inEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to takea more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, hisoffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irishcompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introducedsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.-------------Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.RegardsL.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0

You know'weapons of mass destruction'. etc. etc.==http://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121September 20, 2002Senate Committee Passes Nanotech BillBy Roy MarkThe Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation topromote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. RonWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Actwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill isco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that wouldsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effectiveeducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchersand professionals.""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big stepforward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed tofull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the worldare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm ofnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent tolead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will providethe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitatenew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that willensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.""The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnologyprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would alsocreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and NationalNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative andtechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential tochange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computerrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but willmine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing thebill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across ahalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its variousnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leaderin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential toachieving that goal.To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center forSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related toNanotechnology would also be established.According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of theNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of theNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term andshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support researchthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promotinginterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technologytransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societalimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics formeasuring progress toward program goals.",0

"High-Altitude Ramboshttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top The New York TimesSeptember 23, 2002High-Altitude RambosBy BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from LakeWorth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month inone of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in theU.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight fromAtlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach sectionbegan behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to dowith Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved backto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slightman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuerrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were tryingout for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained himin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quitejittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flightattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals werenot ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. Themarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, andremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for anyreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should tryto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone whodisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there wereterrorists on the plane.""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurizedcabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court ofCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in anaisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfirein a shootout.""Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from herhusband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried thatthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and thereforedid not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to thebathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. Whenthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken intocustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshalsgrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason thatanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station wherehe was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken intocustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frighteninghours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they wereeventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss theincident in detail.

"InfoWorld profile of Max LevchinCongrats, in the end...> ""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was > susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,""http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ct/xml/02/09/02/020902ctspotlight.xmlSecure and at easeBy Jack MccarthyAugust 30, 2002 1:01 pm PTMAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his company for a king's ransom.Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the company.""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good fortune.""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. The trade-off is fundamental.""Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and more than 3 million business accounts.Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's ability to carry out open communications among the millions of participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" Litan says.To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has arrived.""",0

Ooops, no wait, scratch that.There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not beprecisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visitedEngland he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Benexplained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar,and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  TheBritish bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament toclamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies wererife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe politicalparty here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint abouttea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they wereprotesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forcesthat killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believesthey were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canadawas also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in thelate-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from thejuristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.I've wondered about all this.

QED.My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code bymore than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation ofadditional features that drove us to do the conversion in the firstplace.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in Cthan in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endlesscollection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond thecore libraries of any language that much though.On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many thingsdue primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a givennon-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function ina pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, butlibraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me evenif they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn'tparticularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a librarythat really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've builta small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the yearsthat I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse whenyou get right down to it.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

"ALSA (almost) made easyHi all,I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result isthat I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actuallytesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound qualitypeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit fromthat, right? ;-)I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packagesshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) andmaybe others, who knows ;-)Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package- Install the ""alsa-utils"" packageNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/(very complete and very good documentation!)Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably needto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" andinsert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" tocheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels withe.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. Youcan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3files... that's it!It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The onlything I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can'timagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.dstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with thedefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib'sdevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included staticlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version againstwhich the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in therpm release, so does the architecture!).I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!Download :http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/Current spec files :http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spechttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spechttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )MatthiasPS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support!

"[ILUG] PCTel modulesHello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing * cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config* make oldconfig* make depThe 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directoryThe odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience.

"[ILUG] VPN implementationI need to setup a VPN between a few sites.

""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor andamateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don'tlive this high up.' ""Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from abisonone that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinarydiscovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that itcould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There'sprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.""And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers andsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peruto Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars andindustryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. Asthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts isemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deepfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the muckyfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of ourpredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced throughstudying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitudearchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National GeographicSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discoveredin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""IceMan,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, haveoffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, asthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasionaltreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before MotherNatureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains candeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they'reoften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon themdon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier inBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was adead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I lookedcloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a furtrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Locbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumedthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and whatseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunterlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long AgoPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (whomay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved humanfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region couldexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in thefirst place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of peopleliving here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now wesee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedekcaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the southYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered incaribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't beencaribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then awildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like apencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of theice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layercakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to theice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discardedsome equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing dartsup until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the researchproject. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwingdarts.""Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. Theyare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on whereglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known tohave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangelland St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciatedterrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawingEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite asthe Ice Man.

"SunWell, it looks like Sun are going ahead withtheir ubiquitous computing plans without Mithril. GregReuters Market News  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks   Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET   By Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals  making computers which manage networks.   EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference.   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever  needed.   For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from  different vendors to interoperate closely.   Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.   ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said.   Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response  time for priority users, the company said.",0

You have the choice to ignore itThat's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is ""fit to print."" If the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them news.The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the ""publisher"" (if any) decides or the ""community"" (if any) negotiates or does as a matter of custom.For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an expression of their political beliefs.Tom",0

"[ILUG] serial port transient failureHere's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop.

Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where there might be less bogon flux. Still not working.

"Re: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its    hazards (fwd)Hi Kragen,   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a coupleof nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market willbe well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that themost important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fixtheir systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, andyou allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so youmight want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is veryimportant, which is that research into defining and addressing classesof vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of availablevulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automatedmethods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, aboutthe quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research intoa set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that youcan define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time soyou can make and test predictions.   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, wewouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the securityadmin's job would be a lot harder.AdamOn Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 08:42:12AM +0200, Eugen Leitl wrote:| -- | -- Eugen* Leitl <a href=""http://leitl.org"">leitl</a>| ______________________________________________________________| ICBMTO: N48 04'14.8'' E11 36'41.2'' http://eugen.leitl.org| 83E5CA02: EDE4 7193 0833 A96B 07A7  1A88 AA58 0E89 83E5 CA02| | | ---------- Forwarded message ----------| Date: Thu, 22 Aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400 (EDT)| From: Kragen Sitaker <kragen@pobox.com>| To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards| | On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills| itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell| anyone else.| | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.| | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research| known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the| vulnerability, if possible.  | | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible| disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem| was.| | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and| exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible| disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the| underground, vulnerable.| | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as| long as possible.| | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  | | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if| HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the| information.| | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,| together, add up to a catastrophe.| | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.| | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be| --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.| | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.| | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.| | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in| Samba, for example.| | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly| increase the availability of that information to the people who can| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.| | Let's not let that happen.| | | | | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:| | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]| Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program| | | Greetings,| | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.| | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:| | Q. How will it work?| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number| of motivations, including the following:| |          * Pure love of security research|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure| | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following| items:| |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided|          * The potential severity level for the information shared|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other|            software and hardware potentially affected|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE| | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other| entity.| | Q. Why are you launching this program?| A.

"Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National Reviewhttp://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.aspSeptember 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.The Wages of September 11There is no going back.September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take asuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simplybecause the sun still rises and sets.This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashinginto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in realtime by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killersdealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting themanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, andcentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killinghas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morallyrepugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. Bylurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, thevampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats andbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove onlyghoulish not fearsome.The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has foundthem both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicatethem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quiteanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easilydodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make goodtheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and Britishcommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight andan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence ofthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalistparadise on earth.Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition withEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabeticnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the ColdWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade hasinsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft anantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive poweris as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on oftendubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutallyexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for themoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressedthe problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstractmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, andconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shirewhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, withonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved moresobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered Europeanhobbits after September 11.America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostileIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaitimeans nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any morefriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad oftheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to apre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learnthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States isjust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to comefrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistanoffer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governmentsthat hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royalfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, whichhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democraticreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamicgovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses asArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and themilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chickenhawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think ringshollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillnessagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slaveryended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all thosesoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno ofVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is nogeneration of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousandbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been insustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because Americansoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic securityis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up inlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at thePentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather thanrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroadas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable athome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots intoharm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infectthousands in high-rises.Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynicalconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimesrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loatheto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whosebelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they wereso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive SovietCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Championsof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promiseopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments inthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, ifmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Westernconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claimnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not theLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, andidealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican presidentastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and thesubsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, wewill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.",0

""Duncan"" Beberg  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/  beberg@mithral.com-----------------Tech's Major DeclineCollege Students Turning Away From Bits and BytesBy Ellen McCarthyWashington Post Staff WriterTuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might havesought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming anace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imaginedtoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried touse the Internet to end world hunger.But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboringdifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to dosomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""youcan't get the chicks with that anymore.""The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams ofsome fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the techbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments hascome to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. Andeducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with somecolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickledinto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association ofComputing Machinery.""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramaticdeclines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineeringat Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because atsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so farexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer sciencedepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George WashingtonUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computerscience fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in thepast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science andcomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the ComputingResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degreeswere awarded.The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be thefastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with othercomputer-related industries trailing close behind.But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes amongcollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studyinginformation technology and engineering at George Mason University werecomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major isdown to 800, although a newly created and more general informationtechnology major has attracted 200 students.""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend fouryears on something and then not get a job.""Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science majoris expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Marylanddecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone doesnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College ofComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring theirinterest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's afactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expectto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are nolonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is notconvinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on hisadvanced-placement exam in computer science.""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziaksaid. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. Iwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association ofAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have thesame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need thiskind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industryis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down theroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going tofind themselves in a shortage situation.""Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but otherfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and socialinfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professionaldevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perceptionof computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many inthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground duringthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internetas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad thatcame along.""Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School inthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study businessmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, Ithink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's anecessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""",0

"[zzzzteana] Meaningful sentencesThe Scotsman Thu 22 Aug 2002  Meaningful sentences   Tracey Lawson    If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson - the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power.   Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48, has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost.   The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry.   ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point.   This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure.   Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an award-winning film.   Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer, a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received critical praise.   And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak.   So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound.   He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills.   ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.""   However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says: ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine the very essence of who they are.   ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something good?""   Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege.   Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.""   But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into.

"[zzzzteana] Cambodian Buddhaas unearthedhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2220132.stmTuesday, 27 August, 2002, 21:35 GMT 22:35 UKCambodia temple ruins yield treasureWorkers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda innorthern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in goodcondition and believed to be hundreds of years old.They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich templeabout 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn downduring the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area becameovergrown.Community careDeputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearbytown for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at thetemple to take care of them.''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor ofKampong Thom province.''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''Reign of terrorA police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 andcontrolled the country between 1975 and 1979.The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadentor culturally impure.About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodiainto a farmers' utopia. ------------------------ Yahoo!

"RE: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sdraw the pain""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it inworkshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. Youdraw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Takeabout 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefullylistening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurtsand where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes ofthis the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is toimagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay.""Works!

"[zzzzteana] And deliver us from weevilhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.htmlWeevil pest warms to life in south-west LondonJames Meek, science correspondentTuesday October 8, 2002The GuardianThey're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancytaste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: theyare vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's coldwinters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also beendetected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" saidMax Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in Londonwho discovered the creatures in the UK.The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormousdamage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously knownnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likelythese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamentalplants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department storein 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was amigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil insouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but hasestablished itself firmly in the same area.Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, andgrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. Thesoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation ofBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already afact.------------------------ Yahoo!

The application usesmulitple processes to run application code with themain process known as the bsh which controls all i/obe it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handledvia semaphores.In certain circumstances the main process and theapplication child process seem to lock up both waitingfor the syncronisation semaphores to change state, Ihave attached ddd to the processes and it seems thatthe semaphore code is doing the correct things forsyncronisation but the processes stay stuck in thesemop() system call.I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delaybetween changing semaphore states the problem goesaway, but this causes our entire application to runreally sloooww !! lolIs there anything weird or different with the standardimplemenation of semaphores on modern linux that couldcause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in statein a semaphore immediately?Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails(-1) also fixes the problem but again systemperformance goes down the toilet.both the parent controlling process run as the sameuid, and the parent creates the semaphores withpermissions 0666.Any pointers would be appreciated!Rgds,Colin Nevin __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Everything you'll ever need on one web pagefrom News and Sport to Email and Music Chartshttp://uk.my.yahoo.com-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0

"[zzzzteana] US Army tests portable translatorhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stmUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portabletranslation device will be an essential part of their equipment. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of aspeech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translationsystem can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper publishedrecently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly findingitself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues ""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" RobertFrederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital.  Translators could be essential for US soldiers ""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other upand you are holding them apart. ""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on andtalk to them,"" he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commerciallyavailable laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals andtypically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians whoknew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words inCroatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translatedinto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. ""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it wasslow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in thefield. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made towork with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture betweenthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie MellonUniversity. ------------------------ Yahoo!

But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universalstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs intotheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans paybefore they own what they themselves have created?

"[zzzzteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defectedThe Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected  By Bruce Johnston in Rome (Filed: 28/08/2002)    Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.   Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena  Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine, contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.  Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.  Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.  As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.  Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back, was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.  Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers from video footage.  Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.  The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours. But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.  The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not grab their reins.  The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods' boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.  The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin.------------------------ Yahoo!

"CBS News' interview w/Bush & reconstruction of his peregrinations""60 Minutes II"" Bush Interview:(CBS) No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 200 years ago, has seen the nations capital city successfully attacked. But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century.This is the presidents story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11.I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me, Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. Not me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that Im not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as Im president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack.Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis.For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet engines echoed in Manhattan.Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.I thought it was an accident, says Mr. Bush. I thought it was a pilot error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a terrible mistake.Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack.Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the news on his pager. The presidents chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack, Card told the presidentWhen he said those words, what did he see in the Presidents face?I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said, Card recalls. I think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander-in-chief, not just as president.What was going through Bushs mind when he heard the news?Were at war and somebody has dared attack us and were going to do something about it, Mr. Bush recalls. I realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident that we were, you know, that the world had changed.Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America, he said in the speech. Today, weve had a national tragedy.It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didnt know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent ran in.He said to me, Sir, we have to leave immediately and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office, Cheney recalls. Im not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.There wasnt a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president, says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. We knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction, he says.Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice called Mr. Bush.It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the West Wing, says Rice. They were hurrying me off the phone with the president and I just said, he said, Im coming back and we said Mr. President that may not be wise. I remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, Im fine. You have to tell everybody that Im fine but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I think the thing that was on everybodys mind was how many more planes are coming.The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the White House, no matter what.Its important to emphasize it's not personal, you dont think of it in personal terms, youve got a professional job to do, says Cheney.Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital.Says Mineta: Someone came in and said Mr. Vice president theres a plane 50 miles out, then he came in and said Its now 10 miles out, we dont know where it is exactly, but its coming in low and fast.It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bushs limousine sped toward Air Force One in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run, and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out, she recalls.In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling a Secret Service agent Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters protected. At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications Director Dan Bartlett was on board.It was like a rocket, he remembers. For a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up.At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives.Someone said to me, Look at that I remember that, Look at that and I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment, recalls Rice of the TV newscast.She also felt something in her gut: That weve lost a lot of Americans and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of course I felt the anger.Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. I discussed it with the president, Cheney recalls. Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked? He said yes.It was my advice. It was his decision, says Cheney.Thats a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft, says Bush. But it was an easy decision to make given the  given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it was, I didnt hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be done.The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too, says Rice.Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin.The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure location somewhere in Washington. I was horrified, she says. I thought, Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can. It was a nightmare.By 10:30 a.m., Americas largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf Coast.I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the United States, says President Bush. I didnt need any legal briefs, I didnt need any consultations, I knew we were at war.Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. ""Information was just flying from all directions.Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bushs ranch.I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of different information, says Card.They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, Angel is next. The threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get the president home, Tillman says. We actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is.Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from air traffic control  a suspect airliner was dead ahead.Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with, Tillman remembers.Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president.I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back, says Bush.So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in Nebraska. Back in Washington, the presidents closest advisor, Karen Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. Bush.And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, Maam, Im sorry, we cant reach Air Force One. Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didnt recognize.There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to see something like that in, in our nation's capital, says Hughes.When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. I knew it was a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, Hello? and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where I met the vice president.On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He didnt want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the telephone.We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were heading, says Tillman. We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly across the United States.'Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning each other to keep the route secret.OK, wheres he going? one tower radioed to another.Just watch him, a second tower responded. Dont question him wheres he's going. Just work him and watch him, theres no flight plan in and were not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed back: Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 oclock position.The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows, says Bartlett. And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander wouldnt tell them where they were going.He just said, 'Youll know when you see it,' and that was my first clue, I didnt have any idea what we were going up until that point, says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles, says Roberts.Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft, or for his own safety: I looked out the airplane and saw two F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us.We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He hadnt appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, The American people want to know where their dang president is. The staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless, Bush said to the nation from Barksdale.At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had a job for press secretary Fleischer.The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed, says FleischerFleischers notes capture Mr. Bushs language, plain and unguarded. To the vice president he said: Were at war, Dick, were going to find out who did this and kick their ass. Another time, Mr. Bush said, Were not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.The President adds, I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I said, Were going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you and Dick Myers, who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, are going to go get them.By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below.At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground Command Center. It was built to transmit a presidents order to go to nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls that Tenent answered: Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. Were doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers. That was the first piece of hard evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination, says Mueller.In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had enough. He decided to come back.At one point, he said he didnt want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of Washington, Fleischer says. That verbatim.On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America collapsed, one of the nations worst days wore into evening. At the World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil, Bush said recently.Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the way to the White House.Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White House to return to? I dont remember thinking about whether or not the White House would have been obliterated,"" he recalls. ""I think I might have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to take our best shot.Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff were already working on the speech.He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance, remembers Hughes. We had to show resolve, we had to reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. Bush didnt think the American people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that.He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty million Americans were watching.Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts, he said from the Oval Office that night.The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White House daily log: The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. We think it's Osama bin Laden.(CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the president would do. In office for just eight months, hed never been tested as commander-in-chief.I never asked them what they thought, President Bush said of the Pentagon brass, because I didnt really  because I knew what I was gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and bring them to justice.In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war, he said.To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin Ladens organization well before Sept. 11.The president said, You know Im tired of swatting at flies, I need a strategy to eliminate these guys, Rice recalls.In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didnt pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for came too late.Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for was literally headed to the presidents desk, I think, on the eleventh, tenth or eleventh, of September.On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in the past.Well, theres a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway, Mr. Bush tells Pelley. A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense (Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called boots on the ground. That if youre gonna go to war, then youve gotta go to war with all your assets.The president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means.It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the Taliban government.Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.As I like to describe it to my friends, Powell says, we had on the ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the best in the world. How do you connect it all?The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day before, he had called the Pentagon the mightiest building in the world. Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.He wasnt real receptive to that, to that recommendation, remembers Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. And he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening and thats what he did.The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it, says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning.And I just scribbled a little note to him, Powell recalls, and I said, Mr. President, Ive learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up. He looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said, The Secretary of State told me not to break down at the memorial service, and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. I wanted the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.It also stirred the mourners resolve, as Rice remember. As we stood to sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic, she says, you could feel the entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for what he encountered there.You couldnt brief me, you couldnt brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it,"" Mr. Bush says. It was like  it was ghostly. Like youre having a bad dream and youre walking through the dream.The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant, USA! USA!.There was a lot of bloodlust, the president recalls. People were, you know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, Dont you ever forget this, Mr. President. Dont let us down. The scene was very powerful. Very powerful.When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, We cant hear you.The president responded, I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; hed posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidents helicopter landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead  lost at ground zero.When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall.People said to me, Hell come out. Dont worry, Mr. president, well see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - hell find a place to survive underneath the rubble and well get him out. I, on the other hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, This is incredibly sad because the loved ones wont come out.One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the boy, Your daddy wont believe that I was here, so you show him that autograph.It was an effort to provide a little hope, the president recalls. I still get emotional thinking about it because were dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved theirwives who loved their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my tears, I see opportunity.The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground zero.I called the police department, Howard remembers,  and they said he hadnt called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, No, I dont need to call back. If he hadnt called in, I knew where he was.George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldnt stay away. The police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me, Howard recalls. And he extends his sympathy to me and thats when I asked him Id like to present Georges shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there.By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted, recalls Card..The next day  Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.My message is for everybody who wears the uniform  get ready. The United States will do what it takes, Mr. Bush told them.As Powell remembers it, He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. On the other hand, he says, I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning.I wanted to just think it through, Mr. Bush remembers. Any time you commit troops to harms way, a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just spend some time on it alone. And did.What were his reservations?Mr. Bush says, Could we win? I didnt want to be putting our troops in there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened, Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. Well remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.In his desk, the president says, I have a classified document that might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whos out there, where they might beAnd as the terrorists are captures or killed? I might make a little check there, yeah, Mr. Bush admits.But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list  Osama bin Laden.(CBS) A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we still dont have Osama Bin Laden?President Bush: How do you know that? I dont know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. I dont know that. Hes not leading a lot of parades. And hes not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is  were slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. Were after these people one at the time. Theyre killers. Period.Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or alive?Mr. Bush: If he were dead, theres somebody else to replace him. And we would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary so that people dont feel like theyve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives.Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? Certainly, weve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to  everything we could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for which Im extremely proud. No,  I dont second guess things. Its  things never go perfect in a time of war.Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?Mr. Bush: Im committed to regime change.Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for example. Even your fathers former national security advisor, Mr. Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your estimation that they dont understand about the Iraq question that you do appreciate?Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasnt changed. I get all kinds of advice. Im listening to the advice. I appreciate the consultations. And well consult with a lot of people but our policy hasnt changed.Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.Mr. Bush: Yeah.Pelley: I dont think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy that youre considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United States.Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, Im working for peace in the Middle East. Im the first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace. Ive made it clear that in order for there to be peace the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. I've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that theyve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward it. Were more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it as well. But all this business isnt going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight off terror.Pelley: Arafat has to go?Mr. Bush: Either, hes, hes been a complete failure as far as I am concerned. Utter disappointment.Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.Mr. Bush: YeahPelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your administrations decision to close certain deportation hearings. They said, quote, A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the Constitution. Where do you draw the line sir?Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you as an idea that youve thought, No, thats too far. I dont wanna go""Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the Justice Department. I think that Attorney Generals doing a fine job, by the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make, I think thats fine. I mean, thats good. Its healthy. Its part of America.Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from fear?Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. Weve got more work to do.Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?Mr. Bush: I dont think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their governments doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack well deal with it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, well alert people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their lives. It seems like they are.",0

"[zzzzteana] Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too farThe Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far (Filed: 28/08/2002)    So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield.  Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.  Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia.  After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side.  ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.  ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""  The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.  It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops.  And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life.  ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks.""  There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling.  The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics.  While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty.  ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""  One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border.  However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live.  France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".  Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.  Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common. And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.  Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself"".  Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.  ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens.""  Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home.------------------------ Yahoo!

"Re: [ILUG] Sun Solaris..On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 05:13:01PM +0100, Fergal Moran mentioned:> In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX. Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail. Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can makesolaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship withsolaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar toother unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. Oneof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting yourhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a softwareproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. Thereis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from acheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.John-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",0

For processes that are runningmonths at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doinglots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sureevery conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recoversto a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is adesign/programming issue.That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and thenre-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as alanguage for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairlydetailed and low-level control of system resources to get aroundbottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't giveyou access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out ofa C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management.

Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""TheSearch Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the mostsubversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, whichmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. Bymaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforcethese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and fromGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost allWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading toSSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer inChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range ofIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on inthe article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this trafficcosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the freeflow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governorssponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the restof the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sectorprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like.

For the country's fast-growing population ofInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is provingan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blockedaccess to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparentlybecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access toforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has beenrestored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. Moresophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult touse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken byGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way forChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet usersposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internetproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google siteto far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts tocensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blockingindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to befiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for keywords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier thisweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search onGoogle for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinausually aborted before all the results had time to appear.

Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on theway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in thesea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchenfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America andmaybe me and you, too.But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since theBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he soundedhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamicproto-warriors in the background.You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the DailyMail's cartoonist Mac.

And ifwe can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force himto shut up.Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him beforeSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we allthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into politicalpersecution.And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they'vegot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatorymanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out ofcontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. Butperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness andtolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror'sscoop.Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlierthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of hisallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners weremeant to do stuff like that.He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have beenfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to themedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporationsand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to betrue - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if BritishMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one couldturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he wasrevealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of thosegovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorismand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that anoverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thoughtthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at thetime, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy athome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone fromthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of USforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger actionagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don'tsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was gratefulfor the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who hasbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather moreinflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. Hisideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would behappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, forexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterlyrepellent.And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desireto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerfulappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by theruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views thatare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothingremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecutionis simply the pungency of his views.It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because hisrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. Thisis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. Andif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense ofunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it isnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the manup, therefore, won't make a difference.It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.------------------------ Yahoo!

"Keillor voices up on what to do with the WTC sitehttp://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtmlDear Garrison,There are at least six plans about what to do with""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorialsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions suchas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art workswould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.What do you think should done with the space?Joe AdamsHillsdale, New JerseyI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattanthat's designed by committee and that's gone throughpublic hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be coldand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one morepublic space that the public hates, of which there areplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial cityand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of youngambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in thetowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historicevents occurred in New York that in any other city wouldbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides andhistorical museums and in New York there's barely alittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking fortheir big chance, and compared to that spirit ofentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and astatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant'sTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about PresidentGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomband think about lunch, about sex, about money, about allthe things that New York is about. If you want to findGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in NewYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorialcity. New York is for the young and lively.",0

A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.GATHERING THE DATAWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTSA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.GLOBAL COVERAGEOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSUWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERSOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITYWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.THE SCIENTISTSIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.DR.

"Making a mesh on the movehttp://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.htmlMaking a mesh on the moveA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, reports Peter RojasPeter RojasThursday August 29, 2002The GuardianImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream.Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time ""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central antennas, and improving wireless coverage.As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable.Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless connection.Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around £100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by software.It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3G licences.All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone networks.But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs, movies, and video games.But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks.The first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.",0
"The Disappearing Alliancehttp://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802BThe Disappearing AllianceBy Dale Franks 10/08/2002For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been ourclosest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of theCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Wecelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberationof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology thatHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressivetransnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communistprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are thedeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas ofcitizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, andthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as theUnited Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through thepooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While thereis a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelectedEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limitsto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, whereelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has anappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes ofthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desiredby the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justiceregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU membergovernments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list ofcomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the factthat our republican system of government is not based on proportionalrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despisethe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economyis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywherein the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independentnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should berestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decadeor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because itexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather becausethe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion ofthe US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the factremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the Europeanintellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps incheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such asystem in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannotunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of nationalsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than itdoes on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departuresfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equalvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since theprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The troublewith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democraticsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusalsto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve theliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because itsdictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated referencesto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions tocomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on acommitment toconstitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, orcooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism infavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, whiletheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such apolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitablyincrease.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is thethought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of thenew ideology of transnational progressivism.-- -----------------R. A.

This is thecurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earthshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and maybe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. Iencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 toeventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evidentas heat.- Jim",0

They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltageregulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughlythe energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kineticenergy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- ina vacuum.Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much doesthe 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I betit isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially storedelectrically in the capacitor.

"NYTimes.com Article: Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Texas Pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. It's just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendAugust 25, 2002By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG  It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed whenhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airwayslast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leanerand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying andrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flippedthrough his files and found the number for the TexasPacific Group, an investment firm headed by DavidBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputationfor fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filedfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake inAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not letTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? askedRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And daysbefore US Airways announced its plans to file forbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiatedabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - TexasPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed tokick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keepthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed tobuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emergesfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with abetter offer. ""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folkswere,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, inan interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren'tmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge todelve into the airline industry."" Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buyingbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bondermanmade their names during the recession of the early 1990'swith investments in Continental and America West. Thefirm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shapingcompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping itsextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the lastyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed sixacquisitions, most in unloved industries likesemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has beenlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also biddingfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of thesedeals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November ofMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize inleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans andother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have mademanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that arefor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environmentfor them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of theBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of theWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Mostother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.You don't see many guys wanting to take on operationalfixes."" Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keepits inner workings private: its partners rarely grantinterviews and its Web site is perpetually underconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed forthis article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts andbright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and theytend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, aninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early inhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bondermanargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is knownfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekkingin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up onmy caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said oneinvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as thechief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by makingearly bets in industries like cable television and takingstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,which had been seized by the government. Over nearly adecade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annualreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had alsoworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year withMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankersand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the masterstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals andthe detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Priceoften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. ""David is very much the optimist, very much the dealmaker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president ofContinental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He willapproach investments a little bit more skeptically thanDavid does."" By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was wellestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billionfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. Tocelebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented SanFrancisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at aparty. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacifichesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made nodeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporateblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, butstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of thebusinesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existinginvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits duringthat stretch. ""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said MarioGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a moneymanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacificinvestors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for TexasPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies thatneeded its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in therough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the healthmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in themid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in newmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italianmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more thanquadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought atthe top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 millioninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, forwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase ofBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demandfor luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, asemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm'sperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings intwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. Thefirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 andincluding investments made through March 1997, shouldreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacificinvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997- could return less than half that, this investorestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits onthese investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdingsin the second fund, profits on these investments couldrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with newmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as theeconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""theirreturns look pretty good when you consider that some otherfunds won't return any capital"" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies intotrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earliersuccess, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionallywell,"" he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. Itrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructuretroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, exceptfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, itreplaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as hisold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led itto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, thenbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, andin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chiefexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaulof the company and is now considered a great turnaroundartist of the industry. ""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with BobFerguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel forthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing thethinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtimefriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do abetter job."" At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even moreextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge wasled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job ofchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhatkindred spirits."" The board replaced most senior managers at America West,except William Franke, the chief executive, who steppeddown last September. His restructuring plan had made theairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged frombankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worthabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, andthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. ""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L.Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental'sboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active.Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" After overseeing managers who worked successfully withunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has agood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airwayswas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said ChrisChiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as laborfriendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways canstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, thebillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressedinterest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made withGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after twoyears of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and thechain's franchisees - even before the company, which hadbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up forsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the NationalFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger Kingfranchisees. ""We liked what they had to say about the human component ofthe businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many otherowners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with anexecutive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is JohnDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwestbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamoredwith the technology industry, despite the failure of somany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on thesemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry ishighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two andtook both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most ofits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much largerinvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chipmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis inAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed forbankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a thirdcompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more lastyear. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing thepayment to E.On, based in Düsseldorf, Germany, was actuallymore than the acquisition, one executive close to the dealsaid. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Companyof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed toguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. TexasPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most ofwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. ""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" saidNabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who notedthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profitsince the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearlysizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, AmericaWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discountticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines toinvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, asPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web sitebut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time untilafter the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurtHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said thatthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacificremains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen totalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bondermanseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down thesteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.   http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6bHOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contactonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

Idrink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drinkdon't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AAmeetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky inalmost any degree. Were I single, I might considerpotential mates who partook of the less irrationalor more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian orBuddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccanof the second. But someone who is both irrationaland serious about that irrationality strikes me asa bad choice of partner, moreso than someone whowas addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drugaddicts at least have the sense to battle theirproblem, and to keep their children from sufferingit. The religious revel in their irrationality,and want to raise their children in it.

"The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is thestandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using theworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sendingimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain textfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any partof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that arecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in usewhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growingnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popularMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at theUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the hostftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translationcapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you donot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there isstill hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIMEmessage.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developedat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from thehost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versionsavailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility witholder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can alsodecode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files sothat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technicallimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robustencoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive themessage transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME?The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available viaanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:                                                             o  US East Coast                                    Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)                                                                     o  US West Coast                                    Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)                                                                   o  Pacific Rim                                      Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)                                                               o  Europe                                           Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txtAnother source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"",which includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list.--------------------------------------------------------------------------http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

Its relevance is nil.It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the point of the earlier 3-person example. But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice ofvalues results in meaningful differences between the sexes' ""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without sayingso outright, this model actually approximates the cliche ""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you reverse the male and female roles.Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiplepartners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").> So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this> is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.> > There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested> in typical behaviour and you in extreme. Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement tomake it more defensible. What I objected to was:Robert Harley:# >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous# >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.# # Well, DUH!!!# # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,# precisely identical between males and females.# # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have neededto jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-mandefinition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock ananthrolopology professor's conclusions? > Actually, you probably just> had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.You are welcome to that theory!But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. ""DUH!!... perfectly obvious... exactly, precisely identical..."" -- and that pronouncement is itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of popping your balloon. - Gordon",0

What would later come to be called SouthAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on theeast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast-- which no European was known to have seen.The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction ofmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the rightgeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printedalong its top.The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of thecurvature of the Earth.It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- waspublished six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus ofPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around theworld.Did someone get there earlier?...------------------------ Yahoo!

"[zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to restNot fortean, but a moment in time all the same...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stmBetamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years afterlosing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was betterquality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for thefilm rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in themarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult tosecure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for theformat. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in thetelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffinfor Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face ofcompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but nonew ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Because of Javadoc, which is by nomeans perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-partylibs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also reallyhate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to rolltogether a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing astream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relationaldatabases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open anXMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Wherecan I find C libs for those components?  On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socketwhich can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodicallyrefresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, andagain, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langaugebut Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's notready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in Cis just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How doyou evaluate these things without actually fetching every one andtrying it out?In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see thesocial infrastructure for either happening during my professionallifetime.
